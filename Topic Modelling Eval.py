    Given the following **transcription summary** and **list of relevant topics**, evaluate the quality of topic classification for this call. The system should correctly identify relevant topics and avoid incorrect classifications.

    Scoring Instructions:
    
    **Topic Relevance**: Does the list of selected topics accurately reflect the main themes and content of the transcription summary? Are the most important topics captured effectively?
    Score from 1 to 10, where 1 means poor relevance (many important topics missed or irrelevant topics included) and 10 means perfect relevance (all important topics captured, no irrelevant topics included).

    **Topic Coverage**: Does the list of selected topics cover the main points of the call, ensuring no major aspect of the conversation is missed? 
    Score from 1 to 10, where 1 means poor coverage (important points missed) and 10 means perfect coverage (all key points captured).

    **Topic Accuracy**: Are the selected topics correct in the context of the call summary? This evaluates if there are any topics that are incorrectly included or classified.
    Score from 1 to 10, where 1 means low accuracy (many incorrect topics) and 10 means high accuracy (all topics correct).

    **Classification Consistency**: Are similar topics consistently identified across multiple transcriptions of similar nature? Does the system classify calls in a consistent manner across calls with similar themes?
    Score from 1 to 10, where 1 means poor consistency (topics vary significantly for similar content) and 10 means high consistency (topics are consistently identified).

    **Call Classification Speed**: Based on the assumed automated process, evaluate the efficiency and speed of the classification process. This is based on overall execution and expected runtime.
    Score from 1 to 10, where 1 means very slow or inefficient, and 10 means fast and highly efficient.

    **Overall Classification Quality**: Provide a holistic score that considers all the previous factors (topic relevance, coverage, accuracy, consistency, speed).
    Score from 1 to 10, where 1 means poor overall classification quality, and 10 means excellent overall classification quality.

    The transcription summary and relevant topics to be evaluated are as follows:
    
    Transcription Summary:
    {transcription_summary}

    Relevant Topics:
    {relevant_topics}

    Available Topics:
